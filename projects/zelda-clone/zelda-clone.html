      <p>
        Apologies if I clickbaited you! You can't actually play the game here.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you so desire, you can compile and run the game yourself:
        <a href="https://github.com/hfiggs/zelda-clone">GitHub repo!</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        This page will be highlighting interesting game features along with
        snippets of
        <code>&#60;code&#62;</code>.
      </p>

      <div class="w-100"><hr /></div>

      <h2>Intro</h2>

      <p>
        This is a clone of the original Zelda and was built during one semester
        by a team of five students at OSU, myself included. The game was built
        on MonoGame and C# from the ground-up, and was used as a learning tool
        to mature our software development skills.
      </p>

      <div class="w-100"><hr /></div>

      <h2>Raycasting</h2>

      <p>
        During the last week of the project, I researched the topic of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Raycasting</strong></a> because I wanted to integrate a fun and
        interactive lighting system into the drawing steps of the game (just to
        spice things up).
      </p>

      <p>
        Raycasting, in simple terms, is a rendering technique where rays (lines)
        are traced from a particular point outwards, to see what they intersect
        with. For my lighting system, Link is the source point, and the rays are
        truncated where they first intersect with the environment (i.e. walls,
        blocks).
      </p>

      <p>
        You can play around with the demo below to get an idea of how raycasting works.
        Just grab and drag around the "light source" with your mouse.
      </p>

      <div id="raycastingSketch1"></div>

      <p>
        In the demo above, a set number of rays are drawn radially from the
        center. This is fine just for learning, but it doesn't provide enough
        detail to be convincing. Sometimes the rays don't make it into every
        nook and cranny that a real light would.
      </p>

      <p>
        So you might think: "Hey! Just increase the number of rays to get more
        detail." And this does work pretty well:
      </p>

      <div id="raycastingSketch2"></div>

      <p>
        But it's STILL not good enough, because depending on how complicated the
        environment is, we may have to generate a huge number of rays in order
        to get lucky and fill every little crack.
      </p>

      <p>
        But we can be clever and use a trick! We can cast a ray from Link to
        every "corner" in the environment. This will guarantee we hit everything
        that should be lit, and we don't have to use an arbitrarily large number
        of rays to do it.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          class="card-img-top"
          src="../../img/raycasting_raw_demo.gif"
          alt="Raycasting Raw Demo Gif"
          draggable="false"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Ta-da! But it kinda looks like trash! If we fill in the gaps between rays, and use
        some custom shader magic, we can generate a transparency layer to draw
        over top of the game.

        <figure>
          <img
            class="card-img-top"
            src="../../img/raycasting_demo.gif"
            alt="Raycasting Demo Gif"
            draggable="false"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>Ta-da! It's magic... err... not really, just a lot of work.</p>
      </p>

      <h2>Collision Handler</h2>

      <p>
        What's a Collision Handler?
      </p>

      <p>
        When two objects collide, like a boomerang and a wall, somebody needs 
        to take care of it! Or else the boomerange would just fly straight through the wall. 
        That's the Collision Handler's job: to take care of things when objects hit each other.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          class="card-img-top"
          src="../../img/collision_handling_demo.gif"
          alt="Boomerang colliding with wall gif"
          draggable="false"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        I really just wanted to show off the snippet of code below.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          class="card-img-top"
          src="../../img/collision_handler_code.png"
          alt="Collision handler code snippet"
          draggable="false"
        />
      </figure>

      <p>
        This is the main loop for the Collision Handler system. I am very proud of how simple it is! I employed the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Command Pattern</strong></a> 
        to make this system robust, modular, and readable!
      </p>

      <p>
        The Collision Handler simply iterates over a list of collisions, where each collision contains two colliding objects.
        Then the Handler simply looks up the types of the objects in a dictionary and executes the command that knows how to handle the collision
        (in constant time)!
      </p>

      <p>
        The advantage is that each command only knows how to handle collisions for a particular pair of object types, making each command very simple (~30 lines of code).
        This makes debugging and maintaining the codebase a piece of cake. Adding a new type of object to the game only requires updating the dictionary with a couple new commands.
        The Collision Handler itself doesn't need to be touched!
      </p>
